# Codex dashboard links

AIOS's local MCP owns the panel and a small navigation map. The independent
Notion connector owns remote reads and writes. The map contains only a context
title and source names/links, never documents, skills, memories, credentials,
permissions or company policy. It is not a context home or synchronization.

After authorized personal onboarding or a requested source-route change:

1. Verify the selected entry and the actual Docs, Personal Skills, optional
   Team Skills and Memory destinations through the existing provider tools.
   Reuse IDs and source names; do not create a database for the panel.
2. If `aios_sources` is available, read its current context and source revisions.
   Compare the selected context identity. A client task must not overwrite the
   consultant's personal context or its links. If this is not the selected
   personal default, keep that task scoped and leave this panel alone.
3. Call `aios_save_sources` with the selected target, `expectedContextRevision`,
   `expectedRevision`, short context `title`, and `links`. Each link is
   `{ title, target }`; role keys are `docs`, `personalSkills`, `teamSkills`,
   `memory`. Preserve existing roles unless their removal is authorized. Omit
   an unused Team source; never infer a team's sharing permissions.
4. Read back with `aios_sources`. Repeating unchanged metadata makes no write.
   A revision conflict requires fresh inspection, not a blind retry. Do not
   hand-edit plugin caches or the navigation files to bypass these tools.

If the panel tools are unavailable, the verified context home still works.
Report the missing panel registration; do not claim that a fresh install has
loaded new tools. Reopen Codex when its old runtime is still active.

The panel accepts direct link entry without proving remote access. Setup's
verified source mapping is a separate observation. Connection Refresh checks
the official plugin/account, not every destination. Panel clicks open sources;
they never send chat messages, run an agent or query Notion in the background.

Storage is per context identity under `$CODEX_HOME/aios/panel/`, not in the
system prompt. A new context cannot inherit another context's links. The
short AGENTS pointer and Notion's guide still govern agent retrieval and Spaces.
When a verified route changes, update this navigation metadata within that same
authorized change. No background sync, daily task or duplicate company brain.
