# Help a person review the result

Build owns the human-facing handoff for substantive work. Review verifies its
claims; Ship keeps the same handoff aligned with the delivered result. Reuse
the existing PR, document or task instead of creating a parallel report. Match
the reader and the size of the change: a small correction can be one paragraph.

Open with the concrete problem and resulting change. Show the difference using
one useful example, then identify the few places needing attention and any
material tradeoff or decision. Summarize observed checks and remaining limits;
link the detailed evidence. Keep long logs, transcripts and review reports out
of the main explanation, using links or collapsed sections. A failure that
changes the decision stays visible. Avoid a chronology of the agent's work.
Return the handoff itself, without narrating compliance with this method. Combine
problem, example and checks in a short paragraph when sufficient; do not add a
separate heading for every fact or repeat the same limitation in several places.

Choose the clearest evidence for the result. For visible changes, real captures
or an action/result sequence can help; reuse the relevant baseline and capture
guidance in [visual comparison](../../design/references/before-after.md).
For behavior, use a small observed input/output pair or measured result.
For instructions, documents or architecture, exact excerpts or a labelled
explanatory diagram may be more useful than a screenshot. These are explanations
unless actual behavior was exercised; do not claim a measured improvement from
a diagram, a rewritten prompt or an untested example.

Identify the source revision/artifact and relevant comparison conditions. State
an unavailable baseline or check rather than manufacture evidence. Preserve
private data and other work while capturing; use existing tools and authorized
destinations. No new capture dependency, public upload service or Factory
installation is implied. Evidence complements the existing domain checks and
acceptance procedure; it adds no new review or owner-approval gate.

Inspect the rendered handoff before sending it: a person without the chat history
should understand the change, media should be readable, and evidence links should
work for the intended audience. After a relevant change, update the title,
comparison, checks and pending decision in place. Identify historical evidence
as historical instead of silently carrying it to the new result. Respect
existing delivery delegation; present a decision only when one is actually open.
