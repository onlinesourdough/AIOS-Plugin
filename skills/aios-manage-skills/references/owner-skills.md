# Personal skill lifecycle and discovery

Manage Skills owns this personal-owner procedure. Use it when an authorized
conversation creates, imports, edits, renames or removes a personal owner
skill, and when Onboard installs or moves an owner home. Callers link here; do
not copy these steps into another skill. It keeps personal placement,
registration and discovery in the same capability-management lifecycle as
installation, update, removal and rollback. Owner facts and configured Git
sync remain with Maintain context. This is a task-boundary procedure, not a
watcher or permission to audit unrelated skill libraries on every message.

## Choose the owner before authoring

Resolve the configured home and supported format through
[data compatibility](../../aios-onboard/references/data.md). Personal
cross-project methods belong in
`AIOS_ROOT/skills/<name>/`; repository-specific methods stay with that
repository, and external/plugin skills stay with their distributor. Do not
redirect a genuinely independent repository task into personal owner data.

Use the harness's available Skill Creator for authoring and validation, giving
it the explicit canonical destination above. Do not copy the creator into AIOS,
accept its unrelated default directory, or create a second canonical body.
An explicit owner-requested alternative takes precedence; report how its
discovery and backup differ. Pass accepted task intent, not unrelated context.

Prefer a reference to an existing sufficient procedure over a new skill or a
copied workflow. A caller states its trigger and required result; the callee
owns the steps and acceptance checks. Keep distinct responsibilities separate
even when they share vocabulary. Personal facts remain in routed context,
not embedded in the reusable method.

## Reconcile this skill's registration

1. Inspect the canonical body and the same name in relevant native, plugin and
   user discovery locations. Compare the skill's declared name as well as its
   folder name and resolved source. For setup/move, inventory the owner's skill
   folders; for ordinary work, scope this to the changed skill and its old name.
   [Sync](../../aios-maintain-context/references/sync.md) owns any configured
   Git preflight and reviewed delivery.
2. For Codex where supported, register one symlink
   `~/.agents/skills/<name>` to the resolved canonical folder. An absent entry
   may be created under the task's setup/skill-creation authority. An existing
   link to that exact folder is a no-op. A same-name directory, foreign link,
   unknown dangling link or conflicting package skill is a collision: preserve
   both and stop that registration, without overwriting or uninstalling it.
3. For Pi, use the bounded [default adapter](../../aios-onboard/references/adapters.md#default-aios-focused-pi-discovery)
   to load the canonical `AIOS_ROOT/skills` directory directly. Do not depend on
   the excluded ambient `~/.agents/skills` source or add a per-skill Pi path.
   An existing exact owner-root entry is a no-op; an unexpected second owner
   root or conflicting selected package is preserved and reported as a collision.
4. Repoint a moved/renamed Codex link only when the prior target and ownership
   are proved by the accepted change map. Remove an obsolete registration only
   under the accepted rename/removal scope and only while it still matches that
   prior identity. Re-read immediately before changing it. A body edit at the
   same path does not need another link. For an owner-home move, update Pi's one
   accepted root only after proving the prior root and move map. No duplicate
   copies in `.codex/skills` or extra Pi `skills` entries for the same body.
5. If this harness cannot load its supported registration, use its documented native
   registration for the same source and verify it. An unavailable control or
   collision is a reported gap, not permission to invent a loader, broaden
   access, modify caches or register a second source. Other harnesses require
   their own verified adapter.

The canonical skill files travel with owner data; links and native discovery
settings are machine-local and are recreated on the receiving computer. Never
sync whole harness homes or credentials. A scope-specific backup/rename map
must retain original bodies and registration identities; rollback changes only
the task's outputs that still match its recorded result. Preserve later edits.
Deleting a registration does not authorize deleting its body or history.

## Verify before saying ready

- Validate the final skill with the available creator/validator; resolve all
  referenced resources from its canonical location.
- Read back the link/native registration and prove its canonical target. Replay
  reconciliation: it must be a no-op, not another copy or registration.
- Use supported native discovery or a fresh session to confirm the final name
  and source appear once. After rename, confirm the obsolete name is absent;
  after removal, confirm the registration is absent without deleting the body
  unless that deletion was separately authorized.
- For a new or materially changed skill, perform a bounded representative
  read-only or synthetic invocation, verifying that the runtime reads the
  canonical instructions and follows the intended route. Do not publish,
  connect accounts or perform the skill's real external action merely to test
  discovery. Native metadata alone is not behavioral proof.

Report authoring, registration, runtime observation and configured Git delivery
separately. Missing runtime proof is NOT VERIFIED, never "ready to use" based
only on a folder or symlink. If fresh-session pickup requires user action,
retain the completed artifact and give that one step. Only the reviewed portable
source goes through [sync](../../aios-maintain-context/references/sync.md);
syncing Git alone does not install a skill.
