# Verification

Run the maintained source checks from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tests/validate.py
python3 tests/layout-rehearsal.py
python3 tests/context-footprint.py
python3 tests/continuity-rehearsal.py
```

`validate.py` checks native declarations, package inventory, skill frontmatter,
relative links, one shared Codex/Pi skill source, the complete legacy-route map,
discovery contracts, owner-template isolation, external-owner coupling,
conditional Risky Changes ownership/routing, optional Guardrails capability
routing without a package dependency or installed claim, and selected security
regressions. It also builds an isolated package copy so author-only files
cannot satisfy product links.

`context-footprint.py` compares representative selected-read paths with accepted
legacy commit `ca1ba807716d1a992889f02d41cddf94fdee9f32`. The checked-in
manifest records every old path, byte count and source hash used by each stage;
pass `--legacy-root /path/to/pinned/checkout` to verify it again. The benchmark
separates the observed bridge plus all skill name/description metadata from
task-selected skill bodies and complete references. New-home stages also count
the format contract, bridge asset and every neutral owner asset; verification
adds both the common acceptance boundary and setup-specific scenarios. Their
legacy stages count the complete shipped `.aios` scaffold. Other matching stages
cover local-first negative preload, owner routing, Spec readiness, worker Build
and basic Check. Every current selected path must be no larger than its legacy
package-owned comparison, and each skill body must stay at or below 8 KiB.

At the current source bytes, the startup method layer is 12,419 -> 3,924 bytes;
the representative non-startup selected paths are 13.7% to 41.8% smaller. All
skill bodies together are 76,114 -> 50,908 bytes. Total skill Markdown is larger
(128,980 -> 207,007 bytes) because the native plugin owns more supported
harness/setup references; those files are split by real operation/capability and
must not be loaded as one corpus. Aggregate package size is not claimed as a
context saving. The complete neutral setup scaffold is 13,591 -> 5,560 bytes;
this is a package-owned materialization input, not populated owner context.

These are UTF-8 byte counts and explicit bytes/4 token estimates, not native
runtime token telemetry. Populated owner context is excluded: the accepted
snapshot has only template placeholders, not a populated historical owner
state, and task context varies by outcome. Target-repository AGENTS instructions
are also excluded from both sides. The neutral current AIOS.md plus MEMORY.md
assets are 1,016 bytes, but no before/after owner-context saving is claimed.
Behavior remains separately checked by route/link assertions, positive and
negative scenarios, and current source validation; fewer skills alone is not a
performance result.

For a changed context boundary, native evidence must use a compact matched
baseline/candidate task within each harness, record selected reads and emitted
usage when the harness provides it, and state unavailable token fields plainly.
Use synthetic owner and external-canonical sources: an AIOS docs-only question
must not preload owner context. If the canonical product repository is private,
the native smoke may use only its already-authorized normal read path; absent
access is an explicit gap, never a reason to retrieve credentials or change
visibility. External customer content stays at its source; source changes are
re-read; and read-only memory access stays separate from an explicitly
authorized synthetic correction. These are bounded smoke observations, not a
cross-harness performance guarantee.

`layout-rehearsal.py` uses temporary Git repositories to verify independent
Project/System roots, parent exclusions, and rejection of tracked nested work.

`continuity-rehearsal.py` uses a temporary local bare Git remote and synthetic
owner data to verify the explicit Sync allowlist, absent/empty restore, partial
home refusal, hostile remote content, secret-like content and non-execution of
restored personal files. It also checks personal-skill provenance, nested Git
and symlink stops, target-root rebinding and a stale-history stop. It does not
contact a real remote or owner home, and is not native-agent behavioral proof.
Before calling continuity behavior accepted, run the selected synthetic case in
the target native harness and retain its actual selected reads, staged paths,
target mutations and source/target hashes.

Before a real owner-data migration, record and inspect the actual backup restore,
source and destination hashes and modes, changed-source and changed-destination
cases, symlinks, unknown identities, idempotent replay, and preservation of later
owner edits. This is an operator checklist; this repository does not claim those
observations from an invented migration helper or a current native run.

The automated checks are source and Git-filesystem checks. They do not simulate
a model, mutate a real owner home, install AIOS, change native settings, launch
a worker, or prove desktop behavior. Native acceptance must use the target
harness and report its own exact version, source, and limitations. Historical
acceptance observations remain in Git history and GitHub Releases rather than
being presented as a current automated PASS.

For the routing/System-maintenance change, the accepted contract excludes
behavioral evals, replay and model comparisons. Only `validate.py`,
`context-footprint.py`, whitespace and scoped source consistency review were
run; layout/continuity rehearsals and native execution were not run. Required
routing reads are included in the affected footprint paths. Package/link
validation permits the accepted ADS route label while continuing to exclude
specialist tools/formats and bundled ownership. See the
[lifecycle record](lifecycle-routing-system-maintenance.md) for scope and pending
independent lead acceptance. Daily-use feedback belongs to the user; these
checks do not prove workflow selection, sidebar behavior or live System updates.
